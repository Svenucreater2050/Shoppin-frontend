### **Key Features to Implement**

### **1. Case Selection**

- Create an interactive grid of available Apple Watch cases with various materials (e.g., Aluminum, Titanium).
- Implement hover effects on the case selection grid for a sleek and responsive experience.
- Ensure the watch preview updates in real-time based on the selected case.

### **2. Size Selection**

- Include an interactive toggle for selecting watch sizes (e.g., 42mm and 46mm).
- Dynamically update the displayed price and product description based on the selected size.

### **3. Band Selection**

- Design an interactive carousel for band options, allowing users to scroll through multiple band styles and colors.
- Ensure the watch preview dynamically updates based on the selected band.
- Categorize band types (e.g., Solo Loop, Braided Solo Loop, etc.) for easy navigation.

### **4. Collection Switching**

- Add a dropdown or modal allowing users to switch between collections (e.g., Series 10, Herm√®s, SE).
- Ensure smooth transitions between collections, dynamically updating relevant options.

### **5. Real-Time Price Updates**

- Dynamically calculate and display the total price of the watch configuration as users make selections.

### **6. Save and Share Functionality**

- Implement a **Save** button that allows users to save their customized configuration as an image or URL.
- Include shareable links for social platforms.

### **7. Animations and User Experience**

- Add subtle animations to enhance the user experience, such as:
    - Smooth transitions.
    - Hover effects.
    - Loading spinners during interactions.

### **Design Requirements**

- **Pixel-Perfect Precision:**
    - Replicate the Apple Watch Studio's aesthetic down to the finest details (font, spacing, margins, colors, animations).
- **Interactive and Responsive:**
    - Ensure the UI works flawlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **High Performance:**
    - Prioritize smooth interactions and fast loading times.
- **Accessibility:**

### **Expected Output**

1. **Deployment Link**
    - Host the project on a platform like Vercel or Netlify
    - Ensure the deployment is publicly accessible.
2. **GitHub Repository**
    - Share a public GitHub repository link for the project.
    - The repo should include a detailed README file explaining the setup process and features.
3. **Loom Walkthrough**
    - Record a **5-minute Loom video** explaining your implementation process.
    - Highlight key code sections and demonstrate the UI's functionality.
